        <h1>Enhancing Service Integration and Quote Efficiency through Model Number Analysis</h1>
    </header>
    <section id="content">
        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <p>Following recent acquisitions, TSS has been met with the challenge of standardizing service capabilities across numerous regional offices. The processing of client lists of equipment to be serviced is presently inefficient due to varying regional capabilities and an inconsistent knowledge base of equipment and service types. This inefficiency not only reduces potential sales opportunities but also delays response times to customers.</p>

        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>To develop and deploy a tool, accessible to all TSS representatives, enabling quick and efficient search of model numbers. This tool will provide aggregate data, including the most frequently assigned unit types, task types, and used TSS equipment types, thereby facilitating the production of quotes.</p>

        <h2>Methodology/Approach</h2>
        <p>Deploy an automatic Tableau database query. Sync with a universally accessible platform. Create a user training video. Launch an internal marketing campaign. Solicit and implement user feedback.</p>

        <h2>Budget and Resources</h2>
        <p>A potential cost could be adding the Data Management Add-On to the company's Tableau account, with the exact cost to be determined. An alternate solution involves assigning a resource with Tableau access to manually run the flow periodically. Human resources would include 1-3 weeks of work from a Tableau Creator account holder for initial setup, 2-4 hours per week over four weeks for user testing, and one week for post-testing revisions. Thereafter, monthly maintenance and data quality checks would require 1-2 hours.</p>

        <h2>Timeline</h2>
        <p>Weeks 1-4: Initial implementation. Weeks 5-8: User testing. Week 9: Revisions and final implementation. Month 2 onwards: Monthly maintenance and data quality checks.</p>

        <h2>Risk and Mitigation</h2>
        <p>Possible risks include inconsistent data, limited user adoption, and technical issues with Tableau integration. Mitigation strategies include regular data quality checks, comprehensive user training, launching an internal marketing campaign, and maintaining technical support to resolve any system integration issues.</p>

        <h2>Expected Outcome</h2>
        <p>Upon successful project completion, TSS can anticipate an improved process for generating quotes, leading to faster response times to customers. The new tool should enable better utilization of client equipment lists, thus increasing potential sales opportunities. By facilitating a uniform service approach across regional offices, the TSS brand image as a provider of comprehensive and timely service will be enhanced.</p>
